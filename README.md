# Unifying Behavioral and Response Diversity for Open-ended Learning in Zero-sum Games  

### How to run our algorithm?

Create the new environment using:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate diverse_psro
```

### The Real-World Games (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09468)

You can now run Real-World Meta-Games (Alpha Star) by executing

```bash
python3 spinning_tops_dpp.py
```

Tools to analyze and visualize results for Real-World Games

```
python3 plot.py
```

### The Non-Transitive Mixture Model Environment (https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07927)

```bash
python3 non_mixture_model.py
```

Tools to analyze and visualize results for Real-World Games

```bash
python3 analyze_gauss.py
```
